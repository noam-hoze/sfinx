# Employer Console View (Shortlist)

Employers don’t see raw videos — they see **side-by-side CPS summaries** ranked by Fit × Confidence × Trajectory.  
This makes it easy to compare multiple candidates in minutes.

## Shortlist Example – React Frontend JD

| Candidate | MatchScore | Confidence | Trajectory (CIP) | Top Gaps (summary)            | Fairness Flags     |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| **A – Star**    | 92%        | High       | Stable ↑         | Minor CSS, low test coverage  | None              |
| **B – Learner** | 68%        | Medium     | Strong ↑         | State mgmt, messy code        | None              |
| **C – AI User** | 61%        | Low        | Flat             | Over-AI reliance, weak debug  | ⚠ High AI usage   |

- Evidence clips highlight persistence and learning speed.  
- Valuable long-term hire potential.  

### Candidate C – AI User

## Visual Style (for Demo)

- **Table view**: 3 candidates ranked with Fit %, Confidence, Trajectory arrow.
