# Sfinx Demo Guide (Sept 10, 2025)

This demo shows how Sfinx transforms hiring by replacing traditional interviews with **evidence-based profiles** that update continuously.  
Investors will see the candidate journey and the employer view in three steps.

## Job Description (JD) for Demo

**Role:** Frontend Developer (React)  

**Requirements:**  
- Proficiency in **React** and modern JavaScript (ES6+).  
- Ability to build **responsive UI components** with clean, maintainable code.  
- Experience with **state management** (hooks, context, or Redux).  
- Familiarity with **API integration** (REST/GraphQL).  
- Strong debugging and problem-solving skills.  
- Collaboration mindset and willingness to learn.  

👉 This JD will be used in the demo to generate CPS (Candidate Profile Story) reports.

## 1. Candidate Session (Work Evidence)

- Each candidate completes a **short coding/bug-fix task** in a React environment.  
- We show **3 recorded sessions**:  
  1. **Candidate A:** Strong, fast, structured.  
  2. **Candidate B:** Average, learns while coding, some struggles.  
  3. **Candidate C:** Weak, slow, heavy AI reliance.  
- Alongside each video, Sfinx tracks **telemetries**.

### Telemetries
- **Iteration Speed** → how quickly code runs/improves.  
- **Debug Loops** → number of failed → fixed test cycles.  
- **Search & Learning Behavior** → doc lookups, trial & error.  
- **Refactor & Cleanups** → code quality improvements.  
- **AI Assist Usage** → transparency on prompts vs. typing.  
- **Focus & Idle Time** → active vs. stalled effort.

## 2. Candidate Profile Story (CPS)

The **CPS** converts a session into a digestible JD-match report.

### What CPS includes
- **MatchScore** → % fit to the React JD.  
- **Confidence** → evidence strength (recency + diversity).  
- **Top 5 Gaps** → where candidate fell short.  
- **Evidence Reel** → timestamped clips proving behavior.  
- **Workstyle Graphs** → iteration, debugging, learning.  
- **AI Transparency** → tags for assist usage.  

👉 CPS = *“Why this candidate fits the React role, with proof.”*

---

## 3. Continuous Improvement Profile (CIP)

The **CIP** shows growth over time.

### What CIP includes
- **Skill Radar** → React skills mapped (UI, state, API, debug).  
- **Trend Lines** → progress curve across sessions.  
- **Latest Sessions** → most recent work evidence.  
- **Improve Gap Button** → targeted micro-task → instant update.  
- **Versioning** → frozen snapshot for fairness in hiring.  

👉 CIP = *“Candidate isn’t static — they’re improving.”*

## 4. Employer Console

Employers see **insights, not raw video**.

### Employer view
- **Ranked Shortlist** → sorted by Fit × Confidence × Trajectory.  
- **JD Alignment Heatmap** → visual of requirements vs. skills.  
- **CPS Snapshots** → quick JD MatchScores + clips.  
- **CIP Trajectories** → growth trend lines.  
- **Fairness Flags** → context for environment, AI us
