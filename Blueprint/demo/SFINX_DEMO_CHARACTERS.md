# Sfinx Demo Characters

This demo features **three pre-recorded candidate sessions**, each designed to show a different type of signal that Sfinx captures.  
Together, they illustrate the full range of what the platform can reveal.

---

## Candidate A – The Star

**Behavior in Session**
- Codes React components quickly with clean structure and good naming.  
- Uses documentation briefly but effectively.  
- Runs tests frequently with fast debug loops.  
- Refactors final code for readability.  

**Sfinx Signals**
- High **MatchScore** against the React JD.  
- Few **gaps**; telemetry shows strong iteration speed, debugging, and code quality.  
- CIP trend line shows steady improvement on top of an already high baseline.  

**Narrative**
- *“This is a top performer. Sfinx proves their fit with clear evidence, not just a resume claim.”*

## Candidate B – The Learner

**Behavior in Session**
- Starts slowly; searches for “React useContext example.”  
- Encounters multiple bugs and goes through several debug loops.  
- Explains thought process aloud, adapts, and eventually solves the task.  
- Ends with a working solution but somewhat messy code.  

**Sfinx Signals**
- Medium **MatchScore** to the JD.  
- Clear **gaps** in state management and code cleanliness.  
- CIP trend shows strong upward trajectory — learns fast with each session.  

**Narrative**
- *“Not perfect, but highly coachable. Sfinx highlights their learning speed and potential.”*

## Candidate C – The Heavy AI User

**Behavior in Session**
- Pastes large chunks of code from an AI assistant with little editing.  
- Minimal debugging; struggles to explain errors.  
- Achieves passing tests, but structure and comments reveal shallow understanding.  
- Long idle periods waiting for AI suggestions.  

**Sfinx Signals**
- At surface, MatchScore looks okay.  
- **Fairness Flags** highlight high AI usage ratio.  
- Telemetry shows weak learning and debugging signals.  
- CIP flat — little sign of growth across sessions.  

**Narrative**
- *“Other platforms might score this candidate highly. Sfinx exposes the gap: output without depth.”*

## Summary

- **Candidate A (Star):** Excellence proven with evidence.  
- **Candidate B (Learner):** Medium fit today but strong growth trajectory.  
- **Candidate C (Heavy AI):** Superficial performance, flagged for risk.  

👉 Together, these characters show how Sfinx distinguishes **ready talent, growth potential, and hidden risks**.
