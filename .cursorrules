# Cursor AI Rules

## Required Context
- **ALWAYS include @AGENTS.md in every prompt** - no exceptions

## Git Workflow
- **NEVER commit changes automatically**
- **NEVER run git commit unless explicitly asked by the user**
- Only stage changes (git add) when user explicitly requests commit
- Wait for explicit user confirmation before any git operations
