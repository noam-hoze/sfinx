1. Install Docker on your OS (e.g., Docker Desktop for macOS).

2. Open your terminal, navigate to this folder, and build the Docker image:
   
   ```bash
   docker build -t openface . --progress=plain
   ```

3. Analyze a video by running the script with the video file as an argument. Make sure the video is in this directory.
   
   ```bash
   ./run_openface.sh myvideo.mp4
   ```

4. The results of the analysis will appear in the `output/` folder.
