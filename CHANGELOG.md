# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.

## [1.13.2] - 2025-09-09

### Changed

- Interview flow: rely on single hidden completion message; removed `has_submitted` from KB updates.
- AI nudge: send added code only via hidden message; immediately revert to reactive mode (using_ai=false).
- One-time latches: ensure single close and single completion message across manual submit/timer.
- Spec docs: added `INTERVIEW_FLOW_SPEC.md` and aligned `AI_INTERVIEWER_PROMPT.md` guidance.

### Fixed

- Duplicate closing lines caused by dual end signals and HMR replays.
- Double-conclusion race by gating finalization and message sends.

## [1.12.0] - 2025-09-08

## [1.13.1] - 2025-09-09

### Changed

- Session creation is atomic: creates session + zeroed telemetry (+workstyle + gapAnalysis) in one transaction.
- Removed premature Prisma disconnect; added rich debug logs and error payloads.
- Applications API now deterministic: requires jobId and reuses strictly by candidateId+jobId.
- CPS insights components now render data from telemetry and show empty graphs when arrays are empty (no demo fallbacks).

### Fixed

- Typo `interviewSStessionId` → `interviewSessionId` in telemetry create.
- Client updated to send `{ companyId, jobId }` when creating applications.

## [1.13.0] - 2025-09-09

### Added

- Evidence categories for clips (Iteration Speed, Debug Loop, Refactor & Cleanups, AI Assist Usage)
- Zeroed telemetry auto-creation on new interview sessions (ensures CPS shows all sessions)

### Changed

- Job search: cards show jobs (flattened) with role details; API filters by role/location properly
- Applications API: reuse existing application per candidate+job to avoid duplicates
- Telemetry GET: builds evidence links using category (with title fallback)

### Fixed

- CPS telemetry GET returns 200 with empty sessions for candidates without telemetry
- Seeded Noam evidence clips categorized to drive evidence links correctly

### Added

- **Interview Loading State**: Loading button with spinner during interview start process
- **Permission-Gated Interview Start**: Interview only starts if screen sharing permission is granted
- **Visual Loading Feedback**: Spinner and "Starting Interview..." text during setup

### Changed

- **Interview Start Flow**: Screen recording permission checked FIRST before any backend operations
- **Button State Management**: Start Interview button shows loading state and prevents multiple clicks
- **Interview Initialization**: Complete backend setup (application, session, recording) only after permission approval

### Enhanced

- **User Experience**: Clear visual feedback during interview initialization process
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling when users deny screen sharing permission
- **Loading States**: Consistent loading patterns matching app design standards

### Technical

- **Permission-First Architecture**: Screen sharing permission validation before backend operations
- **Loading State Management**: Proper loading state cleanup on success, failure, or permission denial
- **UI State Synchronization**: Loading states properly coordinated across interview components

## [1.11.0] - 2025-09-08

### Changed

- **Interview Flow Simplification**: Removed manual stop interview functionality - interviews now run to natural completion only
- **Timer Expiration Handling**: Timer expiration now performs the same cleanup as user submission (recording stop, state machine submission, "I'm done" message)
- **UI Cleanup**: Removed REC/MIC recording indicators from header - recording still works but without visual indicators
- **Start Button Behavior**: Start Interview button now disappears completely after clicking, preventing any manual stop controls

### Enhanced

- **Interview State Management**: Simplified interview lifecycle with guaranteed cleanup on both timer expiration and user submission
- **Backend Order Assurance**: Confirmed application and interview session creation happens before any recording/frontend operations

### Technical

- **Interview Button Logic**: Removed conditional stop/start logic, simplified to one-way start trigger
- **State Synchronization**: Ensured timer expiration and submission use identical cleanup procedures

## [1.10.0] - 2025-09-08

### Changed

-   AI usage flow simplified: EditorPanel sets `using_ai` on paste > 50; state machine now mirrors to ElevenLabs via KB_UPDATE and sends one hidden nudge message on rising edge.
-   Removed SYS tags, timers, turns, fairness/metrics; lean `useElevenLabsStateMachine` with clear docs.

### Added

-   Inline documentation for `lib/hooks/useElevenLabsStateMachine.ts` and a constant nudge message string.

### Fixed

-   Consistent inclusion of `using_ai` in KB_UPDATEs to prevent accidental clearing by subsequent updates.
